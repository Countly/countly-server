##What's Countly?
Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile phones, tablets and other internet-connected devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data.

This repository holds Countly Community Edition. For more information other versions (e.g Enterprise Edition), see [Editions page](https://count.ly/products/editions/)

##How do I install Countly server?

 
We provide a beautiful installation sript (`bin/countly.install.sh`) with countly-server package that installs and configures everything required to run Countly Server.

If you feel like doing things manually, or need to upgrade Countly from a previous version, please take a look at the installation articles from [http://support.count.ly](http://support.count.ly "Countly Support").

##Dependencies
We develop and test Countly on Ubuntu with MongoDB, Node.js and nginx. Installation script only needs a clean, decent Ubuntu Linux without any services listening to port 80 and takes care of every library and software (e.g MongoDB, Nginx, Node.js, Expressjs etc) required to be installed on Ubuntu Linux.

Countly community also provides scripts to install Countly on [Mac OS X](http://support.count.ly/discussions/questions/161-can-i-install-countly-on-a-mac-server)  or [Debian Wheezy](https://gist.github.com/cbess/6221635)
