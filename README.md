##What's Countly?
Countly is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. It 
collects data from mobile phones, tablets and other internet-connected devices, 
and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. 
There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK 
that sends this data.

We provide a beautiful installation sript (`bin/countly.install.sh`) with countly-server package that installs and configures everything required to run Countly Server.

We develop and test Countly on Ubuntu with MongoDB, Node.js and nginx. It should work in your Linux distribution (e.g Fedora, OpenSUSE, etc), however, you need to install them by hand.
