    location information is available only for the country selected in 
    timezone configuration of an application. 

  * Added ghost graphs for all the 6 time graphs on the dashboard view. A

    data is merged into the existing data which is fetched the first time 
    user logs in to the dashboard.

    page reload. Active application and selected date are stored in

    time.

    A user of an application can only view analytics for that application 
    and cannot edit its settings.
