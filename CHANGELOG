    (width and height) for new and all users using two pie charts (accessible
    from Analytics > Resolutions).

    cores in the server in order to increase utilisation. This can also be
    configured from api/config.js by changing "worker" count.

    that returns ready-to-use metrics for today, 7 days and 30 days. This API
    is used by Countly Mobile Apps.

    database.

    in api/config.js (session_duration_limit).

    the count and sum for the selected segmentation key.

12.09

    following languages: Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, 
    Spanish and Turkish (https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/countly/).

  * Added city level location information to countries view. City level 
    location information is available only for the country selected in 
    timezone configuration of an application. 

  * Added ghost graphs for all the 6 time graphs on the dashboard view. A 
    light gray graph will represent the previous period. For instance if "30 
    days" is selected, ghost graph will show the stats for the previous 30 
    days.

  * Added current month to the available time buckets.

  * Optimized total user calculation for date ranges other than current 
    year, month and day which already show the absolute number.

    an optional sum property. There can be unlimited number of segmentation 
    keys for an event.

    Help, certain items in the interface show a small descriptive text when 
    hovered on.

  * Added option to re-order applications listed in the sidebar.

  * Added option to select a single day from the date picker. When a single 
    day is selected hourly data for that day is displayed.

  * Optimized dashboard refresh process. While refreshing the dashboard, only 
    the data for the current day is requested from the read API. Current day 
    data is merged into the existing data which is fetched the first time 
    user logs in to the dashboard.

  * Fixed active application and selected date reset problem after a hard 
    page reload. Active application and selected date are stored in 
    localStorage until user logs out.

12.07

  * Added platforms view under analytics section.

  * Added app versions view under analytics section and API is modified 
    accordingly to handle _app_version metric.

    version and top resolution.

    the data stored for any application.

  * Added timestamp (UTC UNIX timestamp) parameter to the write API. If 
    provided, the event is recorded with the given time instead of current 
    time.

  * Fixed application delete bug that prevented app_users collection to be 
    cleared. app_id field is added to app_users collection.

  * Fixed JSON escape issue for the read API when device name, carrier name 
    etc. contained a single quote.

12.06

  * Added user management support. A user can be created as a global admin to 
    manage & view all apps or can be assigned to any application as an
    admin or user. An admin of an application can edit application settings. 
    A user of an application can only view analytics for that application 
    and cannot edit its settings.

  * Added csfr protection to all methods provided through app.js.
