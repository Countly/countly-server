The event listener may never be called though.\n\nCaveats & Notes\n---\n- Calling `pause()` might not stop `line` events from firing immediately.  It will stop reading of data\n  from the underlying stream, but any data that has already been read will still be split into lines and\n  a `line` event will be fired for each of them.\n- The delimiter is not included in the line passed to the `line` handler\n- Even though this is called `line-input-stream`, you can delimit by anything, so for example,\n  setting delimiter to `\"\\n\\n\"` will read by paragraph (sort of).\n- You can set the delimiter to a regular expression, which let's you do cool things like drop multiple blank lines: `/[\\r\\n]+/`\n- All methods return `this`, so can be chained\n\n\nCopyright\n---\nPhilip Tellis [@bluesmoon](https://twitter.com/bluesmoon) <philip@lognormal.com> \n\nLicense\n---\n(Apache License)[LICENSE.md]\n",
