This document provides a comprehensive overview of the component system and styling architecture used in Countly's Vue-based frontend. It covers the component organization, styling patterns, and customization options available for developers working with the Countly dashboard. For information about the core frontend system and layout, see [Core Frontend System](#2).

## Component Architecture

Countly's frontend uses Vue.js with a custom component system called `clyvue` that extends and customizes Element UI components. The components are organized in a modular fashion, following a consistent naming convention and styling pattern.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Vue Component System"
        countlyVue["countlyVue"]
        components["components"]
        mixins["mixins"]
        views["views"]
        data["data/vuex"]
        
        countlyVue --> components
        countlyVue --> mixins
        countlyVue --> views
        countlyVue --> data
    end
    
    subgraph "Component Types"
        baseComponent["BaseComponent"]
        inputComponents["Input Components"]
        visComponents["Visualization Components"]
        layoutComponents["Layout Components"]
        dataComponents["Data Components"]
        navComponents["Navigation Components"]
        helperComponents["Helper Components"]
        
        components --> baseComponent
        baseComponent --> inputComponents
        baseComponent --> visComponents
        baseComponent --> layoutComponents
        baseComponent --> dataComponents
        baseComponent --> navComponents
        baseComponent --> helperComponents
    end
    
    subgraph "Styling System"
        clyvue["clyvue.scss"]
        base["Base Variables"]
        elementOverrides["Element UI Overrides"]
        componentStyles["Component Styles"]
        
        clyvue --> base
        clyvue --> elementOverrides
        clyvue --> componentStyles
    end
    
    components --> clyvue
```

The component hierarchy starts with a base component class that provides common functionality. Each component category then extends this base with specialized behaviors and styling.

## Component Registration and Naming

Components in Countly follow a consistent naming pattern, prefixed with `cly-`. Components are registered globally using Vue's component system or created through the `countlyVue.components.create()` method.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Component Registration"
        create["countlyVue.components.create()"]
        Vue["Vue.component()"]
        extend["countlyBaseComponent.extend()"]
        
        create --> component["New Component"]
        Vue --> globalComponent["Global Component"]
        extend --> extendedComponent["Extended Component"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Component Naming"
        prefix["cly- prefix"]
        type["Component Type"]
        name["Specific Name"]
        
        prefix --> type --> name
    end
    
    component --> register["Register with cly-prefix"]
    globalComponent --> register
    extendedComponent --> register
```

For example, input components are named `cly-input-*`, visualization components are named `cly-chart-*`, and so on.

## Core Component Categories

### Input Components

Countly provides a rich set of input components to handle user interactions:

| Component | Purpose | Example Props |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `cly-colorpicker` | Color selection | `placement`, `resetValue`, `value` |
| `cly-dropzone` | File uploads | Vue2Dropzone props |
| `cly-listbox` | Selection from a list | `options`, `bordered`, `skin`, `searchable` |
| `cly-checklistbox` | Multi-selection from a list | `value`, `sortable`, `persistColumnOrderKey` |
| `cly-dropdown` | Dropdown selector | `disabled`, `width`, `placement` |
| `cly-input-dropdown-trigger` | Trigger for dropdowns | `focused`, `opened`, `selectedOptions` |

These components handle various input scenarios and support customization through props, slots, and events.

### Visualization Components

The visualization components provide charting and data display capabilities:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Chart Components"
        chart["cly-chart-*"]
        line["cly-chart-line"]
        bar["cly-chart-bar"]
        pie["cly-chart-pie"]
        time["cly-chart-time"]
        
        chart --> line
        chart --> bar
        chart --> pie
        chart --> time
    end
    
    subgraph "Mixins"
        legendMixin["LegendMixin"]
        zoomMixin["ZoomMixin"]
        externalZoomMixin["ExternalZoomMixin"]
        updateOptionsMixin["UpdateOptionsMixin"]
        eventsMixin["EventsMixin"]
        graphNotesMixin["GraphNotesMixin"]
        
        legendMixin --> chart
        zoomMixin --> chart
        externalZoomMixin --> chart
        updateOptionsMixin --> chart
        eventsMixin --> chart
        graphNotesMixin --> chart
    end
    
    subgraph "Map Visualization"
        worldmap["cly-worldmap"]
    end
```

These components use ECharts under the hood and provide additional features like legends, zooming, and graph notes.

### Data Table Components

The `cly-datatable-n` component provides a powerful data table with features for sorting, filtering, pagination, and dynamic columns:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Dynamic Columns | Configure which columns appear in the table |
| Sorting | Sort by any column with customized sorting behavior |
| Filtering | Filter data with search functionality |
| Pagination | Navigate through large datasets |
| Row Selection | Select rows for batch operations |
| Export | Export table data in various formats |
| Vuex Integration | Connect to Vuex stores for data management |

The data table can work with both local and remote data sources, providing a unified interface regardless of where the data comes from.

## Styling System

The Countly Vue component styling is based on a comprehensive SCSS system contained primarily in `clyvue.scss`. This file provides styling for all Vue components in the Countly dashboard.

### SCSS Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Styling Files"
        clyvue["clyvue.scss"]
        base["Base Files"]
        typography["typography-variables"]
        colors["colors"]
        variables["variables"]
        mixins["mixins"]
        
        base --> typography
        base --> colors
        base --> variables
        base --> mixins
        
        clyvue --> base
    end
    
    subgraph "Component Styles"
        transitions["Transitions"]
        bullet["Bullets"]
        notifications["Notifications"]
        statusTags["Status Tags"]
        theme["Theme"]
        tabs["Tabs"]
        graphs["Graphs"]
        datePicker["Date Picker"]
        radio["Radio Buttons"]
        checkbox["Checkboxes"]
        colorPicker["Color Picker"]
        
        clyvue --> transitions
        clyvue --> bullet
        clyvue --> notifications
        clyvue --> statusTags
        clyvue --> theme
        clyvue --> tabs
        clyvue --> graphs
        clyvue --> datePicker
        clyvue --> radio
        clyvue --> checkbox
        clyvue --> colorPicker
    end
    
    subgraph "Overrides"
        elementOverrides["Element UI Overrides"]
        bulmaOverrides["Bulma Overrides"]
        
        elementOverrides --> elementUI["Element UI Components"]
        bulmaOverrides --> bulma["Bulma Components"]
    end
```

The styling system uses SCSS variables for consistency across components, with separate files for typography, colors, and other design elements.

### Component Styling Patterns

Components in Countly follow a consistent styling pattern using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) notation:

1. **Block**: The component name (e.g., `cly-vue-notification`)
2. **Element**: Child elements (e.g., `cly-vue-notification__alert-box`)
3. **Modifier**: Variations (e.g., `cly-vue-notification__alert-box--full`)

This approach provides a clear hierarchy of styles and makes it easy to target specific parts of a component.

### Element UI Integration and Overrides

Countly uses Element UI as a foundation for its component system but heavily customizes it to match the Countly design system:

| Original Element UI Component | Countly Extension/Override |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| `el-table` | Custom styles for headers, cells, sorting |
| `el-button` | Custom styles, additional variants |
| `el-radio` | Extended with custom skins, layouts |
| `el-input` | Modified for adaptive layouts |
| `el-select` | Extended with custom dropdown behavior |
| `el-tabs` | Custom tab styling |

The overrides are defined in `_element-override.scss` and ensure that Element UI components match the Countly design system.

## Vuex Integration

Countly Vue components integrate with Vuex for state management, with utilities to simplify common patterns:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Vuex Modules"
        module["VuexModule"]
        store["Store"]
        getters["Getters"]
        mutations["Mutations"]
        actions["Actions"]
        
        module --> store
        module --> getters
        module --> mutations
        module --> actions
    end
    
    subgraph "Server Data Integration"
        serverDataTable["ServerDataTable"]
        serverDataSource["ServerDataSource"]
        
        serverDataTable --> datasource["Data Source"]
        serverDataSource --> component["Component"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Component Integration"
        component --> store
        getters --> component
        mutations --> component
        actions --> component
    end
```

The `getServerDataSource` method connects Vuex modules to components, providing a clean interface for data fetching and manipulation.

## Using Components

### Example: Data Table

```html
<cly-datatable-n 
    :available-dynamic-cols="tableDynamicCols" 
    :tracked-fields="localTableTrackedFields"
    :rows="tableRows" 
    :resizable="false" 
    :persist-key="tablePersistKey">
    <template v-slot="scope">
        <!-- Column definitions -->
        <el-table-column fixed type="selection"></el-table-column>
        <el-table-column fixed width="200" sortable="custom" prop="_id" label="ID"></el-table-column>
        
        <!-- Dynamic columns -->
        <template v-for="(col,idx) in scope.dynamicCols">
            <el-table-column 
                v-if="col.value === 'description'" 
                width="540" 
                sortable="custom" 
                :key="idx"
                prop="description" 
                label="Description">
                Custom template content
            </el-table-column>
            <el-table-column 
                v-else 
                width="280" 
                :key="idx" 
                sortable="custom" 
                :prop="col.value" 
                :label="col.label">
            </el-table-column>
        </template>
        
        <!-- Actions column -->
        <el-table-column align="center" type="options">
            <template v-slot="rowScope">
                <cly-more-options v-if="rowScope.row.hover" @command="handleCommand($event, scope, rowScope.row)">
                    <el-dropdown-item command="edit">{{i18n('common.edit')}}</el-dropdown-item>
                    <el-dropdown-item command="remove">{{i18n('common.delete')}}</el-dropdown-item>
                </cly-more-options>
            </template>
        </el-table-column>
    </template>
    
    <!-- Bottom line with diff helper -->
    <template v-slot:bottomline="scope">
        <cly-diff-helper :diff="scope.diff" @discard="scope.unpatch()"></cly-diff-helper>
    </template>
</cly-datatable-n>
```

This example shows how to create a data table with dynamic columns, selection, and action options.

### Example: Visualization

```html
<cly-chart-line :option="lineOptions" :legend="lineLegend" category="vue-example">
    <template v-slot:chart-left>
        <!-- Custom controls can be added here -->
    </template>
</cly-chart-line>

<cly-chart-time :option="largeScaleOptions" :bucket="selBucket" :dummy="true" category="vue-example">
    <template v-slot:chart-left="scope">
        <div class="bu-level-item">
            <el-button @click="onTimeSeriesButtonClick" size="small">Change series</el-button>
        </div>
        <div class="bu-level-item" style="width: 100px;">
            <el-select v-model="selBucket">
                <el-option :key="item" :value="item" :label="item"
                    v-for="item in ['daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'hourly']"></el-option>
            </el-select>
        </div>
    </template>
</cly-chart-time>
```

This example shows how to use chart components with custom options and controls.

## Summary

The Countly Vue component system provides a comprehensive set of UI components with consistent styling and behavior. The system extends Element UI with custom components and styling to create a unified user experience across the Countly dashboard. Components are organized by function and follow a consistent naming pattern with the `cly-` prefix.

The styling system uses SCSS with variables for typography, colors, and other design elements, providing a consistent visual language. The BEM notation ensures that component styles are clearly organized and easy to target.
