## Countly plugins 

Countly provides a seamless experience to extend core mobile analytics and marketing functionality with the help of plugins. Each plugin is a means to be an add-on to what Countly can do, and help product managers and marketing people understand more about their mobile application. 

We provide extensive documentation on bow to build your own plugins. Head over to [resources.count.ly](http://resources.count.ly) to get an understanding of how plugins work, with the help of a sample plugin. 

If you are ready to submit your plugin, we would be happy to evaluate it and include it in our next release.
