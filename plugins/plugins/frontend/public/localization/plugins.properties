configs.help.frontend-production = Initial load of dashboard should be faster, due to smaller files and smaller file amount, but when developing a plugin, you need to regenerate them to see changes
configs.help.frontend-theme = Selected theme will be available server-wide, for all apps and users
configs.help.frontend-session_timeout = User will be forced to logout after this period of inactivity.
configs.help.security-login_tries = Account will be blocked for some time after provided number of incorrect login attempts. See below for time increments.

configs.help.security-password_rotation = Amount of previous passwords user should not be able to reuse
configs.help.api-domain = This is the full qualified domain name used in outgoing emails. It should be in the form of http://SERVERNAME or https://SERVERNAME
