                Drill enables performing advanced analysis/segmentation on your data by applying AND, OR and BY filters to your segmentation properties as well as user properties such as Device, App Version, Platform, Platform Version, Session Count, Session Duration, First Session, Last Session, Country, City and Carrier.<br/><br/>

                With Countly Drill, you can:

                <ul>
                    <li>View data on a line, pie or bar chart, whichever makes more sense for the current data</li>
                    <li>Change the time bucket displayed on the chart and table to hourly, daily, weekly or monthly</li>
                    <li>View how many times your custom event occurred as well as how many users performed it and an average (times/users)</li>
                </ul>

                Drill is something every data analyst should have. Say goodbye to complex SQL queries!

                Using funnels you can understand where you lose your users throughout conversion paths/goals inside your application. Funnel view shows you the number of users passing through each step as well as how many times that action is performed.<br/><br/>
                You can filter your funnel data using any metric including custom segments you send together with your events. This enables A/B testing and comparing conversion rates within different user groups.

                Every company wants its customers to use their application everyday and engage with it. If they find it valuable, then they'll go on with using it, what we call "Retention". Retention is simply condition of keeping your customers. Retention page shows you active days (e.g days your customer used your application) after first session. On the retention page, you'll see a breakdown of daily, weekly and monthly retention.<br/><br/>

                With retention page, you can consistently monitor how much impact does each application change affect your customer. This is one of the most important metrics for mobile app analytics and is available in Enterprise Edition.
