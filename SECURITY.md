# Security Policy

Security is very important to us. If you discover any issue regarding security, please disclose the information responsibly by sending an email to security@count.ly and not by creating a GitHub issue.

All software related security bugs with severity of medium and higher will be awarded accordingly with a bug bounty reward.

# Vulnerability levels
**Critical Severity:** software can be exploited at any time without any additional information

**High Severity:** some additional information, access or action required (from the user, like clicking on injected link) for software to be exploited

**Medium Severity:** the impact is limited (for example, can only access limited information) or requires special conditions to achieve it (when server is configured in specific way)

**Low** - no bounty rewards, does not directly lead to vulnerability, but provides a possibility (like exposing software version, which can be mapped to specific vulnerabilities), old dependencies, server misconfiguration

**Exclusion**

Server specific configurations and deployment specific configurations due to on premise nature of our software.
All server configuration related issues will be reported to related departments/parties/companies, but we cannot guarantee any bounty rewards for them.
