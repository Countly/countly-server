  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master, next, feature/new-ui ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, next, feature/new-ui ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
