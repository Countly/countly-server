# This patches the NGINX Ingress Controller to enable OpenTelemetry
# Apply after both nginx-ingress and observability-stack are deployed:
# kubectl apply -f 03-observability-stack/nginx-otel-integration/nginx-otel-configmap-patch.yaml

# Note: This is a standalone patch that should be applied directly
# It cannot be used with kustomize as it patches a resource in a different deployment
